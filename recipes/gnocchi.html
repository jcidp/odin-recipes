    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy sausage gnocchi is a comforting, indulgent dish with ingredients like wine, cream, and shallots. I do not recommend adding salt because I find the sausage has enough salt. Although cheese is optional, I find it gets lost in the sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Italian-style turkey sausages, casings removed</li>
        <li>4 ounces portobello mushrooms, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 shallots, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)</li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) package potato gnocchi</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Italian herbs (such as cantanzaro herbs from Savory Spice Shop®)</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until crumbly and no longer pink, about 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms, shallots, butter, and oil; cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms and shallots are soft and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Add garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Pour in white wine and simmer until wine has reduced by half, about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in boiling water until pasta floats to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Add gnocchi, cream, Italian herbs, pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cook over medium-low heat until sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
